    Team Name: Zelix

Project Summary:

ShieldHer is a secure, anonymous platform that empowers women to report harassment safely, share evidence, access support, and build a community â€” all while ensuring privacy, credibility, and cybersecurity.

Problem Statement

Women often face harassment or unsafe situations but hesitate to report incidents due to fear, stigma, or a lack of secure channels. Existing solutions rarely allow for anonymous reporting, safe submission of evidence, or real-time support, leaving victims vulnerable. Furthermore, fake reports can misuse resources and reduce platform credibility. There is a critical need for a tech-driven, private, secure, and trustworthy platform.

Proposed Solution & Key Features

ShieldHer provides a comprehensive and compassionate solution with the following key features:

    Anonymous Reporting: Users can submit incidents without revealing their identity.

    Photo/Video Evidence: Secure uploads to strengthen reports.

    Cybersecurity Measures: The platform features end-to-end encryption, secure authentication, and robust data privacy protocols.

    Support Network: Connects users to verified NGOs, helplines, and legal advice.

    Awareness & Guidance: Offers AI-powered suggestions for immediate next steps and safety measures.

    Community Support: Anonymous forums and chat groups for sharing experiences and advice.

    Emergency Quick Actions: Includes a prominent SOS button and a real-time alert system to trusted contacts and authorities.

    Location-Based Safety: Maps showing nearby safe zones, help centers, and verified safe routes.

    Educational Resources: Provides articles, tutorials, and tips on personal safety and cyber hygiene.

    Fake Report Management: Utilizes AI-assisted verification and moderator reviews to prevent misuse, with a clear appeal system for genuine users.

    Multi-Language Support: The platform is accessible to women across different regions, with language options including English and Malayalam.

Implementation Plan

The project is structured with a clean separation of concerns:

    Frontend: A responsive web application interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It handles the reporting form, evidence uploads, and access to support features.

    Backend: (Conceptual for the hackathon) A secure database with encryption for storing reports, media, and user interactions.

    AI Module: (Simulated in the frontend) An AI chatbot for user guidance and a framework for fake-report detection.

    Integration: Features such as real-time location sharing and helpline number displays are integrated into the frontend logic.
