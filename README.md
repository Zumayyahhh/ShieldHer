Project Summary

ShieldHer is a secure and anonymous digital platform designed to empower women to report harassment, share evidence, and access support â€” all while ensuring privacy, trust, and cybersecurity. Beyond reporting, ShieldHer fosters community support, provides verified resources, and leverages AI to guide victims in real-time.

Problem Statement

Women often face harassment but hesitate to report incidents due to fear, stigma, or unsafe reporting channels. Existing platforms lack features like true anonymity, secure evidence submission, and immediate support, leaving victims vulnerable. Additionally, fake or malicious reports can undermine trust and waste resources.
There is a critical need for a tech-driven, private, and trustworthy solution that empowers women while ensuring safety and credibility.
